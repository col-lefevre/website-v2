# personal-site
My personal website. Made by me, using many creations of others:
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) and [Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/)
  - All the handy features of Jinja2 on a static site!
- [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/)
  - A nice class minimal approach with plenty of space for customization (so, not full Bootstrap)
- [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - I may not like full Bootstrap, but their grid is pretty handy
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
  - Manually downloading fonts and icons should have been in Dante's Inferno
