# personal-site

This is my personal website, made by me using many creations of others. Keep in mind that is a very eclectic mix of different technologies, some of which are not strictly intended for static sites. So, don't judge this amalgamation too harshly--I can write more normal code, I promise. :)

External Resources:

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) and [Frozen-Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/)
  - I am bizarre and enjoy the structure of Flask, so I am making the very strange choice to use it for static site development
- [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/)
  - A nice class minimal approach with plenty of space for customization (so, not full Bootstrap)
- [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  - I may not like full Bootstrap, but their grid is pretty handy
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
  - Manually downloading fonts and icons should have been in Dante's Inferno
